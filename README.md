Inspiration
The Sigma Calculator was inspired by internet culture and the growing fascination with personality archetypes like "Sigma" and "Chad." We wanted to create a humorous, interactive tool that merges entertainment with simple tech concepts to engage users in a lighthearted way.


What it does
The Sigma Calculator takes a string input from the user, processes it through a randomized algorithm, and generates a playful "Sigma" evaluation. It also features an animated loading screen with randomized, humorous messages to keep the experience engaging.


How we built it
We built the Sigma Calculator using:

Frontend: HTML and CSS for the user interface.
Backend: Python (Flask) to handle the input, output, and logic.
Hosting: Deployed using a lightweight server setup for quick access.
We collaborated closely to design and implement both the technical and creative elements.

Challenges we ran into
Randomization Logic: Ensuring the randomness of outputs felt natural and diverse.
Dynamic Loading Screen: Creating an engaging loading screen that felt unique each time.
Team Coordination: Balancing creativity with functionality during the hackathon time constraints.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Designing a project thatâ€™s not only functional but also fun and culturally relevant.
Building a user-friendly and responsive interface within a short timeframe.
Incorporating humor and creativity to make a memorable hackathon entry.

What we learned
The importance of balancing technical execution with user experience.
How to integrate humor and randomness into programming effectively.
Enhanced skills in Flask, Python, and collaborative project workflows.

What's next for Sigma Calculator
Adding more unique and dynamic outputs to keep users entertained.
Expanding the randomization logic to make the evaluations more personalized.
Hosting the project on a public platform for wider access and feedback.
